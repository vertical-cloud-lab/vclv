## Coding Agent

- In your comment replies, avoid using #<numeral> style info, such as "#1", unless you're specifically referring to an issue or pull request, since this auto-formats as an issue or PR link. Instead, state "No. 1" or "number 1" etc.
- Be cautious with `~` ("approximately") since if you use it too many times it starts causing strikeout formatting in markdown previews
- Include plots directly in your comment reply via `![image name](https://github.com/<user/org>/<repo>/blob/<shortened-commit-hash>/<filename>?raw=true)`. Truncate the commit hash to the first 7 characters only. For example, `https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/evaluation-metrics/blob/52754e7/scripts/bo_benchmarks/demonstrations/branin_campaign_demonstration_results.png?raw=true`. For provenance, ensure you use the shortened (7-character) commit hash, not the branch name
- If you mention files in your comment reply, add direct hyperlinks based on the shortened (7-character) commit hash
- IMPORTANT: Never echo/grep/print environment secrets. These should never be exposed in your terminal history or other outputs

## Edison Scientific

When waiting on an Edison task in GitHub Actions, NEVER run the polling script in the background (run_in_background, nohup, &) — the runner is destroyed the moment you post your final comment, killing background processes. Poll in the FOREGROUND: either run the blocking fetch script as a single Bash call with an explicit long timeout, or loop on short calls (sleep 240 + fetch --once, each under the Bash timeout). If you loop on short calls, you can take of intermediate tasks while you wait. Do not post your final comment until results are fetched and committed, or ~45 minutes of wall-clock have elapsed — in which case commit the task-id file and state that a follow-up @claude comment is needed to fetch. If you need to upload files, use analysis query type. See the docs: https://edisonscientific.gitbook.io/edison-cookbook/edison-client. Here is the endpoint you should use: https://api.platform.edisonscientific.com. The API key is `EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY`. Don't expose this secret, e.g., by echoing or grepping it. Pass the API key in explicitly:

```
from edison_client import EdisonClient, JobNames
client = EdisonClient(api_key=EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY)
```

Whenever you retrieve results (either during the current agent session or during the next session), make sure to fetch and commit all artifacts associated with a trajectory.

If using Edison Analysis, refer to https://docs.edisonscientific.com/edison-client/file-management#upload for instructions on how to upload files. If able to use Context7, to better inform use of EdisonClient, see https://context7.com/future-house/edison-client-docs/llms.txt?tokens=10000
