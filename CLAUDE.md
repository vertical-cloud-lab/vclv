## Coding Agent

- In your comment replies, avoid using #<numeral> style info, such as "#1", unless you're specifically referring to an issue or pull request, since this auto-formats as an issue or PR link. Instead, state "No. 1" or "number 1" etc.
- Be cautious with `~` ("approximately") since if you use it too many times it starts causing strikeout formatting in markdown previews
- Include plots directly in your comment reply via `![image name](https://github.com/<user/org>/<repo>/blob/<shortened-commit-hash>/<filename>?raw=true)`. Truncate the commit hash to the first 7 characters only. For example, `https://github.com/AccelerationConsortium/evaluation-metrics/blob/52754e7/scripts/bo_benchmarks/demonstrations/branin_campaign_demonstration_results.png?raw=true`. For provenance, ensure you use the shortened (7-character) commit hash, not the branch name
- If you mention files in your comment reply, add direct hyperlinks based on the shortened (7-character) commit hash
- IMPORTANT: Never echo/grep/print environment secrets. These should never be exposed in your terminal history or other outputs

### The GitHub token dies at minute 60 (push early, re-mint to continue)

The GitHub App token a session starts with (`GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` in the
session environment, and embedded in the origin remote URL) expires exactly 60
minutes after the Run Claude Code step starts. The session keeps running, but
`git push` fails, `gh` fails, and the MCP tool that updates the progress
comment fails, all with 401, so from the outside the session goes silent while
finished work stops landing.

- Push and update the tracking comment early and often. Treat minute 50 as the
  deadline for anything that must reach GitHub, in case recovery fails.
- At the first 401 from a push or `gh` call (or proactively around minute 55),
  run `python scripts/refresh_github_app_token.py`. It re-runs the action's
  own OIDC exchange, saves a fresh one-hour token to `/tmp/.ghtok` (mode
  0600), and re-points the origin remote at it, so plain `git push` works
  again. Validated live on a 125 minute session that re-minted hourly.
- `gh` keeps reading the dead token from the environment, so prefix each call:
  `GH_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/.ghtok) gh ...`. Separately, `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_TOKEN`
  is a distinct token that lasts the whole job and works for reads at any age.
- The MCP comment tool cannot be re-keyed mid-session. After a re-mint, update
  the tracking comment over REST instead: write the body to a file and run
  `GH_TOKEN=$(cat /tmp/.ghtok) gh api -X PATCH
  repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/issues/comments/<comment-id> -F body=@that-file`.
- A re-minted token also lives one hour, so re-run the script each hour it is
  needed. Never echo, log, or commit a token value; the script prints only
  statuses and lengths.

## Edison Scientific

When waiting on an Edison task in GitHub Actions, NEVER run the polling script in the background (run_in_background, nohup, &) — the runner is destroyed the moment you post your final comment, killing background processes. Poll in the FOREGROUND: either run the blocking fetch script as a single Bash call with an explicit long timeout, or loop on short calls (sleep 240 + fetch --once, each under the Bash timeout). If you loop on short calls, you can take of intermediate tasks while you wait. Do not post your final comment until results are fetched and committed, or ~45 minutes of wall-clock have elapsed — in which case commit the task-id file and state that a follow-up @claude comment is needed to fetch. If you need to upload files, use analysis query type. See the docs: https://edisonscientific.gitbook.io/edison-cookbook/edison-client. Here is the endpoint you should use: https://api.platform.edisonscientific.com. The API key is `EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY`. Don't expose this secret, e.g., by echoing or grepping it. Pass the API key in explicitly:

```
from edison_client import EdisonClient, JobNames
client = EdisonClient(api_key=EDISON_PLATFORM_API_KEY)
```

Whenever you retrieve results (either during the current agent session or during the next session), make sure to fetch and commit all artifacts associated with a trajectory.

If using Edison Analysis, refer to https://docs.edisonscientific.com/edison-client/file-management#upload for instructions on how to upload files. If able to use Context7, to better inform use of EdisonClient, see https://context7.com/future-house/edison-client-docs/llms.txt?tokens=10000
